# Patient Distribution

The rate of patients entering the hospital is given in a file as a discrete
distribution or histogram. The data is divided two times, first in days and each
day is divided in an arbitrary number of equally sized bins. The number of bins
must be equal for all the days.

The file is formatted as CSV, each line is a day, an each column represents a 
bin or interval of the day, indicating the number of patients entering the
hospital in that span of time. The day starts at 00.
